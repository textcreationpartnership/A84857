            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<list>
                  <item>I. That had the King come up to <hi>Londen</hi> (as they have ≈øo oft de≈øired and attempted) it is apparent they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and would have made u≈øe of it, rather to lay the ≈øtronger foundations of a new war, then any way to ≈øettle thereby a ≈øafe and well-grounded Peace.</item>
                  <item>II. And ≈øince they could not rationally expect ≈øo ca≈øie an obtaining of the Kings Per≈øon to <hi>London,</hi> upon any pretence what≈øoever, yet it is evident, that they could intend nothing thereby, but a more plaudible pretence and foundation of quarrell again≈øt this Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to engage or incline to their a≈ø≈øi≈øtancethe Kings Party, and ≈øuch others who might bee catcht with the apprehen≈øion thereof, as a ≈øpeedy way to Peace (the thing ≈øo generally longed for) and by ≈øuch a≈ø≈øi≈øtance
<pb facs="tcp:114506:4"/>gained, the better to ruine this Army, and tho≈øe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Members of Parliament who retired to it.</item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For our parts wee ≈øhall reioyce as much as any, to ≈øee the King brought backe, to his Parliament, and that not ≈øo much in place, as in affection and agreement, on ≈øuch ≈øound terms and grounds as may render both him and the Kingdom, ≈øafe, quiet, and happy, and ≈øhall be as ready as any to bring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty to <hi>London,</hi> when his being there may be likely to produce (not greater Di≈øturbances or Di≈øtractions, but a Peace indeed, and that ≈øuch as may not be ≈øhaped and moulded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the private advantages of a particular party or faction, but bottom'd chiefly on grounds of common and publike ≈øafety.</item>
                  <item>IV. That if (without regard to the≈øe con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) we would have brought his Maje≈øty with us to <hi>London</hi> in our late advance thither (which our Enemies could not hinder or prejudice us in) we had no cau≈øe to doubt, but (as to men) wee might have had all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which our Adver≈øaries promi≈øed to them≈øelves thereby, added to the ≈øtrength &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:114506:4"/>intre≈øt of the Army, and have inverted the di≈øadvantages upon them that they intended again≈øt vs thereby, ≈øo as his Maje≈øties coming to <hi>London</hi> might have beene much to their preiudice and our advantage, if we had regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only our own particulars.</item>
                  <item>V. That we have not minded nor bin acting our own workes and intere≈øts, but the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and every hone≈øt mans in it.</item>
